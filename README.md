# Ghost Busters

## Get saterted
```
git clone https://github.com/rh-ty-blog/ghost-busters.git
```

## How to play
The goal of this excercise is to find the 4 ghosts and put them into jail.
* Pinky
* Inky
* Blinky
* Clyde

You will see a jail folder and a few folders where the ghosts could be hiding

## Game Interface
To check your progress or restart run this command from the project

```
    .scripts/game.py
```

You will need to use these commands:
* cd: to navigate the files
* ls: to see what is in the directory
* mv: to move the ghosts to jail

## Hints 
* You can use mv <file name> ../ to move the file backwards in the directory.
* If you want to move a file back two directories use mv <file name> ../../
* When you use the mv command but you do not spceify a valid folder you will rename the file.
